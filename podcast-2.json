Here's a snapshot of Thursday, August 17. Robbie Slater analyzed the Matildas semi-final loss to England. If you look at our wins against top nations in England, we did beat, not so long ago, 2-0 in our last friendly, well, I think second or third last friendly before this tournament began. And that was their first game in 18 games at that stage. And we'd beaten France, we'd beaten a host of top countries, top 10 countries along the way. And the way we did that really is we play a counter-attacking style of game, which means you are passive in defense, you drop back, you wait for the other team to make a mistake. And then with our pace with Razor and Ford and Kerr, and to a lesser extent, maybe Fowler, we hit them on the break and it's been so successful. That's what we did against Canada. We repeated that against Denmark. A real toe-to-toe fight with France. But if I look at last night, for your question, I think he got his tactics right. I think that's the way we usually have success. I know it might look passive, and England did have the majority of the possession, the problem being, I just think their system, we played a 4-2-3-1 with Ford wide, Razor wide on the right side, of course Kerr through the middle. Now England played with a back three, and that means you play with two wing backs on the outside, right and left. And that was Daley and Bronze, and they hurt us. They found a way out every time. They were very clever the way they did it. And the problem there, because Daley and Bronze were getting so much ball, it was forcing our attacking weapons in Ford and Hayley, Razor to defend most of the time. And in that first half, and that's exactly what happened. So yeah, I think the tactics were right. I just think they moved the ball better. Their movement was better. And Gerard, it's no excuse. It's definitely not an excuse, but there's no doubt, Gerard, that the turnaround favored England, and that's not their fault. It's just the fact of the way those quarterfinals went. And Shannon Gill on the halo effects, created by the Matildas. I'm trying to look at this with the glass half full. So I think we all had that moment of the lifting of spirit when Sam Kerr kicks the goal. Could this happen? Obviously things don't go the way we want them to go, but I'm kind of clinging on to that moment and thinking that in 20 years time, what will I think of? I will think of that. So we talked about moral victories in the cricket. Maybe that's a moral victory back the other way. Obviously the figures, 11 million, so many of those 11 million are in a good way, bandwagon jumpers who have not seen her do her thing. So I think a lot of us were, okay, when's this gonna happen? And when it didn't happen in the first few games when she was injured and then, but we got it. We got the moment, which that's the thing I'm grabbing onto right now. Mark Duffield assessed whether Adam Simpson's job is now on the line at West Coast. Yeah, I think very delicately. I think there's been a clear shift in the board's position from, well, Adam's got a contract, so therefore we want to honour that contract and we believe he's the man. So now it feels like it's a matter for discussion at the board. And I think Adam's own view of his position is that it's a lot more shaky now in the wake of a derby. A derby, the loss in a derby, particularly a loss of that magnitude gets felt very keenly because you are competing directly with the other team in town, not just for on-field business, but for off-field business as well. And it tends to cut a fair bit deeper than other losses. And I think it was felt across the board at West Coast. How rapidly might things happen, do you think? Well, I still think the board is determined to wait until the end of the season and then discuss matters at the end of the season. But the piece I wrote for Codesports yesterday basically suggested if you're even thinking about this, what are you going to know in two weeks' time that you don't already know? And why shouldn't Adam Simpson be given the send-off that Hearn, Shewey and Nattanooy will be given off? He's a Premiership coach. You know, there are only three men that are in the team, they've ever coached Premierships at West Coast, and only one of them has taken a team through a season without being beaten in Victoria. And that is Adam Simpson. I think he holds a significant place in West Coast footy history. And I think he should be treated as such, not shunted out the side door. Brenton Sanderson with the strategic takeouts from the Carlton, Melbourne thriller. I think the DNA of both teams, and I've talked before about a finals template, I think most teams now across the AFL but at community level as well, you know the way now that you wanna play. And yes, there's some teams that are challenging for September that have got a few calculated risks to take to try and qualify. But Carlton and Melbourne now know what their finals template is, and it's gonna be the arm wrestle against two different styles. And like you said, Jude, if those two teams meet again, we're gonna be set for a cracking game because they're both gonna try and execute that different game style. The thing I liked about Melbourne in this game too is Vaini Patraka, Oliver Brashewell, they all played well. So yeah, it's Cripps and Carlton and that midfield in contest. Kerrno up forward, that target with the small forwards pressuring. And Melbourne's midfield, yeah, can they get the contest and clearance right and then get the ball out in transition and run? So yeah, it's gonna be excellent to see how far these two teams go with a game style that they know is gonna be successful. And Jacob Weetering mocked the notion Carlton is better off without Harry McKay. Yeah, I haven't read too much about it, I've certainly heard murmurings around it and I find it laughable, to be honest, Jerrod. It's very hard to draft one key position player that you keep on your list for a long period of time, let alone a column medalist. And we've got two of them, they're the same age that we've got locked away for a while and they're quality, quality players, both different as well. And I guess it's in a way Charlie's form and the way he's been going about it probably has magnified the debate a little bit more. He's probably had to step up, he's had to win and have a lot more contest, he's got two or three guys going to it at most inside 50s. So and his ability to just, yeah, obviously get a score on the board or do a role for us has been awesome. So I mean, Harry coming back probably takes a load off both of them and gives us two targets rather than just the one. So mix that in with Tom DeConning in his form and the Smalls, Jack Martin. Yeah, it's a very exciting forward line combination for mine. And that's just a snapshot. The full programme and all interviews are available through the Waitley podcast. Subscribe at sen.com.au.

Robbie Slater analyzed the semi-final loss of the Matildas (Australian women's soccer team) to England. He discussed how the Matildas have had success in the past by playing a counter-attacking style of game, waiting for the other team to make a mistake and then capitalizing on it. However, in this particular match, England's tactics and movement on the field gave them the advantage.\n\n3. Shannon Gill discussed the positive impact the Matildas have had, despite the loss. She mentioned the uplifting moment when Sam Kerr scored a goal and how it will be remembered in the future. She also highlighted the increase in support for the team, with over 11 million people following their journey.\n\n4. Mark Duffield talked about the uncertainty surrounding Adam Simpson's job as the coach of West Coast Eagles (an Australian Rules Football team). The board's position on Simpson's contract has shifted, and a recent loss to a local rival has raised questions about his future. While the board initially planned to discuss the matter at the end of the season, Duffield argued that they might not gain any new insights in the following two weeks and suggested giving Simpson the recognition he deserves as a successful coach.\n\n5.
